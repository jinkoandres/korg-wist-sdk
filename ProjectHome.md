## Welcome to WIST SDK! ##

KORG has developed the WIST (Wireless Sync-Start Technology) functionality for iOS devices. The WIST SDK is now available to all iOS music developers for free! The benefits of WIST technology are now available for iOS music apps!

## What is WIST? ##

  * WIST allows for wireless sync-start between two WIST-compatible apps on two iOS devices located near each other.
  * 3G or Wi-Fi connections are not required as WIST uses Bluetooth.
  * There are two modes, Master and Slave.
    * The first device will be treated as the Master for sync-start, sync-stop and tempo.
    * The second device will Slave to the Master settings.
  * The setup process is very simple and easy.
  * WIST creates co-marketing opportunities within compatible apps. Your app will be listed on the [WIST page](http://www.korguser.net/wist/) and it will be available from each compatible app.
